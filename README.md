# Description

This is a small program written in Javascript, to calculate accumulated investments.

Imagine you have a capital and you want to invest it, and reinvest its annual profits, without adding any external amount to the initial capital. Finally, after some years, you want to know how much your capital will become and its annual profits.

This is exactly what this script do, it takes as input: `initial capital`, `percentage of investemnt` and `years of investments`. And then it outputs the results.


## Example 

### Inputs: 
investmentApp(100, 15, 10)
- `100` is the initial capital
- `15` is the percentage of investemnt
- `10` is the years of investment

### Outputs:
- Initial capital: 100
- Percentage: 15%
- Profit after 10 years: 52.77
- Capital after 10 years: 404.56


# PS:
Later, I may create a UI for this code.
